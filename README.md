xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".

## Error during Compilation

When compiling the xv6, encountered two compilation errors, I compile on
platform macOS with HomeBrew, install QEMU stable version 10.1.2,
riscv/riscv/riscv-tools stable version 0.2.
So I changed two places in the source code pulled from
git://g.csail.mit.edu/xv6-labs-2021, one is infinite recursion error in
`/user/sh.c`, the `runcmd` function, another one is incompatible pointer in
`user/usertests.c`.

I fixed the first error by change signature of `runcmd` to be
`__attribute__((noreturn)) void runcmd`, according to
[this link](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv/pull/126).

I fixed the second error by change the signature of `rwsbrk` to be `void
rwsbrk(char *s)`, according to [this link](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv/commit/a3f3a04f913535868f5030d9845f7e4b90edb379).

Now I can compile successfully.
